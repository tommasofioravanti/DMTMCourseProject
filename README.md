# The Project
The project was developed during the course of Data Mining and Text Mining in Politecnico di Milano. The dataset was taken by Business Integration Partners (BIP) and it describes the sales of 43 distinct products over 3 years (from December-2016 to December-2019). Our goal was to forecast the weekly sales of 12 of those 43 products over 2 months.
We have done also lot of analysis in terms of timeseries as for example the search of <i>trend</i> and <i>seasonality</i>, the study of the <i>autocorrelation</i>, <i>clustering</i> analysis and so on and so forth.

For what concern the models, we have used different models like <i>LightGBM</i>, <i>Incremental XGBoost</i> and <i>CatBoost</i>. At the very end we also used a <i>stacking</i> approach, to combine all the precedent models.

For more specific details and the code, see the notebooks inside the <i>consegna</i> folder.
